## Database.js

Hold's every database filling stuff for T1 cracker (also some other methods I use in other scripts that I'm just too lazy to remove). Not char efficient but you could remove header & header references for char saving (**but really should take it just as example**).  If one finds it and don't give a fuck, just copy, paste & upload as private.

## t1.js

Holds every t1 lock cracker. Not efficient agains w4rns yet. Not char efficient.

## t1v2.js

Holds every t1 lock cracker. Not char efficient. But w4rn proof (AFAIK);
